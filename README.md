# Xware-Selfbot
Discord Self Bot / Automated User!
<div align="center">
      <p><i><b>Fun, Trolling, Raiding, and more! </b></i></p>
      </div>


# BEFORE YOU CONTINUE
Selfbots are strictly against the Discord Terms of Service. Your account can get Disabled if you're caught using this!
Running the start.bat file and actually using this Project is basically you requesting Discord to Disable your account.
If you want your main account to be Safe. I would Highly request you use this on an Alternative account!

# Discord Server Invite!
We now have a Discord Server! the invite: **[Link](https://discord.gg/uBHNqbeFcH)**

# Installation

Run the `install.bat` file so it can install all the files\
Wait until it's Done
# Setup
Before setup your config file should look like this
```json
{
    "token": "token-here",
    "prefix": "prefix-here",
    "botID": "bot-id",
    "password": "bot-password-here",
    "nitro_sniper": false,
    "whitelisted": [""],
    "embedOptions": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```
In order to get the automated user / Self bot to work.
1. Navigate to the botconfig.json file.
2. Change the token to the users token. (Watch a tutorial if you don't know how) (Just type in how to get my token on yt)
3. Change prefix to a desired prefix
4. Change botid to the users ID
5. Nitro sniper is Optional. So change it to true if you want to snipe nitro gifts in servers you're in
6. Whitelisted is also Optional but make sure you have your ID in it.
7. Embedoptions are optional. When you use commands that use embeds. You can either set true to false or keep it as true
(False disabled embeds. True enables embeds)
7. And you're done!


# Turning on the self bot / automated user
After you're done all of the steps run the `start.bat` file.
