# Jai-Automated-User-Discord
Discord Self Bot / Automated User!

# Installation

Run the `install.bat` file so it can install all the files\
Wait until it's Done
# Setup
In order to get the automated user / Self bot to work.
1. Navigate to the botconfig.json file.
2. Change the token to the users token. (Watch a tutorial if you don't know how) (Just type in how to get my token on yt)
3. Change prefix to a desired prefix
4. Change botid to the users ID
5. Nitro sniper is optionable. So change it to true if you want to snipe nitro gifts in servers you're in
6. Whitelisted is also Optionable but make sure you have your ID in it.
7. And you're done!
Your config file should also look like this ```js
{
    "token": "token-here",
    "prefix": "prefix-here",
    "botID": "bot-id",
    "nitro_sniper": false,
    "whitelisted": [""]
}
}
```



# Activating the self bot / automated user
Just simply run the `start.bat` file!

# Jai Automated User Discord RULES
1. Don't just claim the files as yours. That's just dumb...
2. That's all

# User automation / Self bot risks
I would strictly recommend that you don't use your main acc's token for this\
You have the risk of your Account get `DISABLED` or even `BANNED!`\
So use on an alternative account.
I am also not responsible for any actions taken when using this project.
Be Careful and have Fun!
