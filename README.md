Wait until it's Done
# Setup
In order to get the automated user / Self bot to work.
1. Navigate to the botconfig.json file.
2. Change the token to the users token. (Watch a tutorial if you don't know how) (Just type in how to get my token on yt)
3. Change prefix to a desired prefix
4. Change botid to the users ID
5. Nitro sniper is Optional. So change it to true if you want to snipe nitro gifts in servers you're in
6. Whitelisted is also Optional but make sure you have your ID in it.
7. And you're done!
Your config file should also look like this
```json
{
    "token": "token-here",
    "prefix": "prefix-here",
    "botID": "bot-id",
    "nitro_sniper": false,
    "whitelisted": [""]
}
```


# Turning on the self bot / automated user
After you're done all of the steps run the `start.bat` file.

# Xware-Selfbot TOS
1. Don't just claim the files as yours.
2. I am not gonna show my Main Discord Account For reasons such as. Someone will possibly snitch and get me banned.
2. That's all

# Latest Updates
I have updated the main file (index.js) and I have obfuscated all of the coding in it. (So skids can't do there job and steal the coding)

# User automation / Self bot risks
I would strictly recommend that you don't use your main acc's token for this\
You have the risk of your Account getting `DISABLED` or even `BANNED!`\
So use on an alternative account.
I am also not responsible for any actions taken when using this project.
Be Careful and have Fun!
